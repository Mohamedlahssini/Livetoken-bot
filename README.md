# NBATopShot Sniping Bot
This bot is designed to automatically spot interesting moments on livetoken.co and purchase them directly on the NBATopShot website in a fast and non-robotic way ! 

Requirements: Nodejs & Puppeteer.

Notes & tweaks: - The flame and droplet parameters can be changed to tweak the bot.
       - The parameter for the headless browser can also be changed to false to be able to see the browser but it will make the bot slower.
       
IMPORTANT:
       - Don't forget to create a .env file where you set the GOOGLE_USER and GOOGLE_PWD for automatic login.

More information coming soon.
